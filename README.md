# Pitch-Charting-App

This is a Java applet to chart pitches, for use by the Pomona-Pitzer baseball team. Before this project, the pitch charting had been done by hand on paper and therefore the data was difficult to utilize in any kind of statistical modeling. 

Now, the data is available in CSV form and and image of the chart is created as well.
